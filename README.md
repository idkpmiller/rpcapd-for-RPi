This repository is for binary files for rpcapd, this tool allows wireshark on a different computer to remotely connect 
and live stream packets being seen or generated by the remote device.

I did not in most cases compile the file(s) but I have tested they function.
With this tool a raspberry pi can become an excellant remote diagnostic tool allowing for example in-line tracing configurations
or even configurations where the RPi will call home and join a VPN and provide remote visibility.

I have personally used both of these configurations in my day job and found it to be really useful during the covid-19 lockdown.
I hope this will assist others too.
